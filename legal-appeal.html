                Many people who receive negative decisions from USCIS have the
                right to appeal. An appeal is a request for a higher authority
                to review your case.

            <div style="line-height: 32px; font-family: Outfit" class="mt-4">
              <p>
                You probably know that certain criminal convictions can make you
                ineligible for a green card or U.S. citizenship. But did you
                know that there are waivers available in some cases?
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have been convicted of a crime that makes you
                inadmissible to the United States, you may be eligible for a
                waiver of inadmissibility. A waiver of inadmissibility allows
                you to overcome your inadmissibility and obtain a green card or
                U.S. citizenship.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be eligible for a waiver, you must demonstrate that your
                inadmissibility would result in extreme hardship to your spouse,
                parent, or child who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent
                resident.

              <p>
                If you have received a Request for Evidence (RFE) or Intent to
                Deny from USCIS, it is important to respond quickly and
                correctly. An RFE is a request from USCIS for more information
                about your case. Intent to Deny is a notice from USCIS that they
                are planning to deny your application.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have received an RFE or Intent to Deny, our attorneys can
                help. We will review your case and help you gather the evidence
                that USCIS is requesting. We will also respond to the RFE or
                Intent to Deny on your behalf.

                VAWA also provides protection for children who have been abused

            <h3>Deportation Proceedings</h3>
            <div style="line-height: 32px; font-family: Outfit" class="mt-4">
              <p>
                Deportation is the process of removing a person from the United
                States after they have violated immigration laws. The most
                common reason for deportation is unlawful presence in the
                country. Others include criminal convictions, immigration fraud,
                and visa overstay.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are facing deportation, some of the defenses against
                deportation that may be available to you include:
              </p>
              <ul style="margin-top: 20px; line-height: 30px">
                <li>
                  <strong> Asylum:</strong> If you fear persecution in your home
                  country due to your race, religion, nationality, political
                  opinion, or membership in a particular social group, you might
                  be eligible for asylum.
                </li>
                <li>Being able to read, write, and speak English</li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Cancellation of Removal:</strong> This is available
                  to certain long-time residents of the United States.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Adjustment of Status: </strong>This involves applying
                  for a green card from within the United States.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Waivers of Inadmissibility:</strong> These are
                  available in certain circumstances and can allow an individual
                  to remain in the United States despite certain grounds of
                  removal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Voluntary Departure:</strong> This allows you to leave
                  the United States voluntarily and avoid the negative effects
                  of a removal order.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Our US deportation defense attorneys have extensive experience
                representing clients in removal proceedings and will work
